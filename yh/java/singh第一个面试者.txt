我不要
你们几个坐后面
叫他姓名
后面
Brad
Hi Brad 你好
Hello
I don't hear us
Hello
I don't hear us
Hello I don't hear us
Hello I don't hear us
Yeah I can't hear you
Yes I think today's video is better
It is not too long
So we will set a closer video
OK
OK so
Just speak to us
To make sure that we can hear you clearly
Yeah I can hear you clearly
OK OK OK
So
Yeah
OK
And for today's interview
We have two interviewers
I'm Joyce
And I'm from software development PM
And this is
Albert
Albert he is a development engineer
Also from software department
OK
And he will show us
How to make you speak more slowly and more clearly
OK
OK
OK could you introduce yourself
Tell us a little more about yourself
Yeah sure
So
My name is James
I have 6 plus years of experience
And I'm from Java background
And background that I have contributed to Golang language also
And if I talk about other tech stack
I was a microservice developer
So maybe developing microservice architecture
And if I talk about clients
Then I have worked for
Worked for Tmobile, Pearson and CMEX
Right now I'm related with CMEX
So in the current assignments
We are working for IoT based application
So in current assignments
We are having industrial automation
Industrial automation project
In which we are working
So in this we are following
Micro service architecture
And we are developing
Micro service in multiple languages
Like Golang, Java, C++, Node.js
In front end we are using Angular
And apart from that in technology stacks
I have worked for Spring
Spring library
And on database we have used
MySQL
And Oracle as well
And for servers we have used
Tomcat
Tomcat, Nginx and Apache
And in deployments pipeline
If I tell you that
We were using GitHub
We were using GitLab pipelines
And we were using
Bitbucket and GitLab
And in clouds we were using
All three cloud
All three cloud
Google and Azure and
And apart from that AWS, IB
So this is
Technology stack what we have done
So I think that's all
And apart from that
If I tell you my project
It was the IT based application
So industrial automation
Basically we were developing apps
For industrial automation
So in that we have lot of team
But I was a part of
Data manipulation team
Data processing team
So in this we were using
IoT protocol that is MQTT protocol
So Eclipse Power MQTT we were using
And so in my team I was contributing
For basically we were capturing data
From our industrial automation sensors
Like if you see Node-RED
We were using Node-RED and other things
So we were capturing data from sensors
And we were sending it to the MQTT hub
And then we were creating
From MQTT protocols
And after that we were processing that data
And we were publishing that data
To the IoT cloud
And in that IoT cloud
It can be Azure or AWS or
And other clients also
Hello Raja
I think the connection is not smooth
Sorry I did not get your call
Hello
We can't hear you now
Is it drinking something or
What is your question
Now it is cracking up
Am I on the proper
Ok let's continue
You can ask
I think that's all from my side
Ok
And from your resume
I think that you have good educational background
And after you educated from 2000
And as a team
You have full work experience
And all of them is not very long
So we'd like to know about your career goal
How do you design for it
Sorry can you come again
I could not understand what you are asking
Ok I am from your self introduction
And your resume
And that you have good educational background
And also a lot of technologies
So after you graduated
You have full work experience
Yes from 2016
So could you tell us about your career goal
Yes so I started my career as an intern
I think my resume should be mentioned
First company was I3C Logics
So there I was the intern
And after that I got an SCL
And after that SCL I joined other companies as well
So I started my career as a Java developer
And right now I am contributing for
Java and Polymer
So my career I would prefer to be in future
As a technical architect or something
That is the last one
Ok how much do you know about Voxcom
Voxcom I don't know Voxcom
Ok and for our company
And we are producing and assembling iPhones for Apple
And about us and our software development department
And our major is to develop some new tools for our company
For our production
And usually for us we mainly focus on developing some new software tools
And for our company we are
The National Electronic Manufacturing Company
We are the largest electronic manufacturing company
And the fourth largest information technology company by value
And besides this we have some
Professional software questions
And Angelia will ask you these questions
Yes Mr. Shing
I have some questions about your project
So are you ready?
Yes sure
Question one
How do you use Spring Security to implement low-basis access control?
How did you use Spring Security to implement low-basis access control?
You are asking in the end of it so I missed
Our question is did you ever use Spring Security?
Spring Security did you ever use about it?
Spring Security you are asking?
Yes
So our question is how did you use Spring Security to implement low-basis access control?
So actually in right now
In last project I have not used
But in earlier starting of my career I have used it
So basically we were using Spring Security for role-based access control
So in that we can do the role-based access control
But in our own security authentication and authentication we were using that Spring Security
Okay
And next question is how did you use ERC to monitor and analyze system logs?
Can you come again sorry
How did you use ERC to monitor and analyze system logs?
System logs
Yes
Use ERC
This is what we are talking about right?
Okay
Did you ever use ERC?
Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch you are asking?
Yes
Yes
Yes
Did you ever use it?
Yes
Actually that is for related to logging purpose
In our application if we have lot of logs
Then for filtering those logs or monitoring that dashboard
And capturing the events
We can use Kibana Kibana as a dashboard
And ELK Elasticsearch for searching that
It's like a solar search kind of thing
Elasticsearch ELK and LogTest
LogTest basically we use for transporting that log from our application to some other location
Wherever we want to put that
So and then
So LogTest will be transferring utility
And Elasticsearch will be searching utility
And then in that
We can create our dashboard
How we can
How we want to see this structure
So in that we can use that
That Kibana
So that we did it earlier with this
Okay
Go ahead
How did you handle inservation and errors in Java and Golang?
So
Exception and errors in what?
Exception and errors in Java and Golang?
How did you handle it?
If you
Here is a
In search
In that word
Errors and search in what?
Errors or exception you are asking that?
No
Our question is
How did you handle exceptions and errors in Java and Golang?
Golang
Same
Yes
Same point
In Java we have exception handling
Because we have throwables
And we have some keyword that we use
It's kind of five keyword
Throwables
Finally
And try catch
So
In Java we have everything properly
So
If something
Something we are processing we can put it in try block
And then if it fails or it gives something wrong
Then we can catch and try
We can catch that exception in that
In that finally block
And then we have another block that is a catch block
But in Golang we don't have any such kind of exception handling
In Golang we have a multiple variable
Multiple variable return type
So like if we have something in Golang
And we want to throw error or something
Then we can return error as a second variable
So in function we can return multiple variables
So in that way we can handle in Golang
But in Java we have properly everything
So that is there
Ok
Ok
And I want to
How do you use Docker and Kubernetes in your project
In our project
We will deploy our microservices in Docker environment and Kubernetes environment
So
We will deploy backend services in Docker components
So basically
Docker is a container
So we will be having Docker engine
We will be creating Docker engine
And then we will be deploying that
Docker images
Into the Docker components
Docker is just like
It will manage multiple images or multiple containers
So in that case
We were using Docker components
And for frontend we were using
We were using Kubernetes
So in Kubernetes we were creating multiple containers inside one port
So this approach we were following
We were creating a deployment.yml file
And we were just applying that
qctl
qctl apply
And then
Deployment file
So we were deploying in that way
And for development we were using
MiniQ and K3S
For local setup
But in actual environment
We were using a multi-node cluster
So in that way we were deploying our microservices
That approach we were
And for memory and other things
We were using Docker stacks
In that way we were calculating our
CPU usage, memory usage
And PID usage and other things
In that way we were using them
OK, go to the next
OK, OK
Have you used Redis as a cache or messaging query?
How did you use Redis as a cache and messaging query?
Q
OK
So I have already told you
We were developing for data processing
So we were reading data from sensors
So we were getting data from MQTT protocol
So sensors can produce data at any rate
It can be a per second
It can be a high rate or it can be a simple rate
And then we know that every IoT cloud
Has some limits for accepting that data
And we were publishing that data to the IoT cloud
So if our sensors are generating more data
Then we cannot directly push that data to the IoT cloud
So for caching we were using that Redis
If data rate is very high
First we will store
And then
And then
And then
that way
And then
From Redis
And then we will push to the IoT cloud
So in that way we were using this
Redis cache
And for message queue
Basically we were having one requirement
From client side
They wanted to connect as a queue
So for that
For that connectivity
If we don't want to send that data to directly cloud
Then we can send that data to you
That RabbitMQ
So we were giving also one more connectivity
Related to that RabbitMQ
So in that way we were using this
Ok
Ok
And I see
You also use Kafka to implement message queues
Yes
Kafka
In last assignment
In PSR assignment I have already used
But right now we are not using that
In this current assignment
But that is also same as in this RabbitMQ
So altogether kind of thing
RabbitMQ
And how did you use it
Kafka in your project
What is useful
Actually
他不用說
Ok
Ok
I got it
I don't have much right now
In current assignment
I am not using
But I can tell you earlier
So basically in Kafka
Or you can say RabbitMQ
Or you can say MQP
We just use to
We just use to publish and
Publish and subscribe mechanism
So
And then we use to have that topic kind of thing
So
If you talk about MQP
Or if you talk about the
No no sorry
If you talk about that
RabbitMQ in Kafka
So we use to
We use to have that mechanism
Pub sub channel kind of thing
So in Kafka
We use to subscribe particular channel
And
We use to subscribe particular topic
And then we will
We will be publishing that data to that topic
And then in some other client
We will be subscribing that
That topic
And we will be receiving that data
So it is a kind of mediator
For sending data
So
Kafka we can use some real time situation
So in that way we can use that
But right now I don't have much
Actually I have to wait for that thing
But Kafka I can
Ok ok ok
And I will see
The last job is
The last job is in Siemens
Yeah
Which one
Your last job
The last job in Siemens
Yeah
We saw the one project
Information from your resume
And last year you have a project
During
In
National private company
Yes
There is your client
Is Siemens
Yes
Can you understand that
Which two you are saying
Yes
From your project detail
Two
Project detail two
Yes
There is one working experience
Project experience
This project is for Siemens
Let me open my email
You are asking something
Siemens
Which one you are asking
Can you
Ok
Ok
You are asking I think
Who am I talking to
Ok
We saw that
You have a project information
Details
From
During
Two
Kind of
Two thousand and
Nineteen
To
To TLD
To TLD
Larger private limited company
Yes
From this period
We have a question
About it
So
Could you briefly talk about
In industrial age
IO2
Basic
Age
Computing
Platform
Project
Yes
I already
I think already told you
It was a project related to
IOT based application
So it is
It is related to industrial automation
If you see
In industrial automation
We have a lot of
A lot of
Muscles
So for
For collecting those data
And monitoring those muscles
And managing
We will be generating
That
Sensor data
And then we will be
Connecting those sensors
Using the S7 connector
And some other connectors
And then from
And from the
And from those connectors
We will be receiving data
Using the RQ2D protocol
So
We will receive all the data
In JSON form
And then
We will be formatting
Or whatever
Data
Manipulation
Processing
And we will be
Publishing that data
In cloud
Data
Public
Tool
Same thing
Is mentioned
I think
This technology
They used to call in CMS
As an age
Computing
That's why
Age computing
Is mentioned there
Ok
Ok
Besides this
We were so
Curious about
What kind of
Business
Do you mainly
Realize
From this project
Sorry
Oh yes
Yes
From
Since your
Briefly
Introduction
About this project
So we'd like
We'd like to know
What kind of business
Did you
Mainly realize
What kind of work
I've done there
That you were asking
We
I asked
What kind of result
Have you got
From this project
What kind of project
Yes
You
From this
This project
You got
What result
After your
Implement
This project
And
Managed
Managed it
So
What kind of result
Have you achieved
Yes
They have
There I have learned
A lot of technology
If you see
There
Earlier
I don't have much
Knowledge about
The container
But after
After getting this
Container technology
I
I have learned a lot
In here
In container
But earlier
I was not
Able to get
A lot of
I have gained the
Understand
Yes
OK
OK
And
I want to know
What is
The biggest difficulty
In this project
And
How
How to solve it
And how did you solve it
The biggest difficulty
In this project
Sorry
I am not able to
Understand what you are asking
If you can
A little bit better
OK
I
I think
This is a
Communication
And let me
Just
Summarize
About it
Our question is
Focused on
Your
Latest
Working
Experience
Yes
Your experience
From
November 2019
To here
Today
Today
Yes
You still
You are working
In
Large
Large
Project
In China
Is that correct
Any last
Question
You are asking
OK
OK
So
This
After
Our
Brief
Communication
So
We also have some
Other
Questions
Besides
Professional
Skills
Since our company
Is an international company
So
If you
Fairly
Successful
Join us
We maybe have
Some
Oversea
Business trip
So
I'd like to know
Can you accept it
Sorry
OK
OK
Can you understand
Sorry
I'm not able to get you
Why not
Sorry
I repeat it again
My question is
If you successfully
Join us
To our
Our duration
And
We will
We may have
Since our site
Is in China
In
Foxconn
Factory
In China
And now
We have
The factory
In India
Now
If you successfully
Join us
Then
You may have
Some
Oversea
Business trip
Can you accept
About it
Yeah
I'll get a chance
And I will be
Continue to
Do my
Whatever I can
I will be doing that
OK
Since
These
These business trip
Is usually
About
Maybe not a month
Maybe about one month
Maybe sometimes
Maybe
Two or three months
Can you also
Accept it
Sorry
Yeah
Last
In three months
Whatever has
Been done
I
My question is
Maybe in the future
When you
To come to
To China
To our
Our
Main
China factory
We may have
Some
Oversea
Business trip
And
We may have
A China factory
For this
Business trip
We usually
It's about
One month
We usually
Consistent
Two
Three
Two or three months
Can you accept
About it
For long time
So are they
So are they
Okay
Okay
And
This actually
Since our
Development
Development
If we have some
New project
Compared to lunch
We may have some
Necessary
Necessary overtime
Overtime
Can you also
Accept about it
Okay
Can someone
Speak
Little bit
Consciously
Sorry
Can you understand
No little
Actually
I'm not properly
Understand your
Wordings
Whatever you are
Little bit
I think it's my
Tongue issue
Whatever you are
Speaking
I used to
Sometimes
I used to
I think
Maybe sometimes
Depends on
Depends on
Our project
Requirements
If we launch
A new project
We usually need to
Do some
Necessary overtime
Maybe
Two or three
Hours
A day
Maybe
Forty
Forty hours
A week
So
But it's not
Okay for you
In the future
Okay
I think you are
Asking
Stretching
Stretching time
I think
This happens in
90
Chapters
It's a normal thing
It depends on
Sometimes
It used to happen
In
Siemens also
In other clubs
So
It used to happen
I think it's not
An issue for
Okay
So
And sometimes
Maybe we
Use a laptop
We usually
Use a desktop
So
We also
Use to
Overtime support
On the office
Or on the phone
Is that okay?
If we are using desktop
Then in that case
I have to
Use the laptop
Right?
Okay
So
Okay
And
Since I
Since I
Okay
We have
Another question
Since
You have worked
For your
Previous company
For about
Three
Three years
More than three years
So we'd like to
Why did you
Leave your
Current company
And want to
Join to us
To our company
No
Actually
The reason is that
One issue
I am facing
There is no issue
With that company
I have been working
For about
Three years
So
I have to
Leave my
Current company
And want to
Join to us
To our company
So
I have to
Leave my
Current company
And want to
Join to us
To our company
So
I have to
Leave my
Current company
Everything is fine
But
There is one
But actually
I want to
It's a issue
Related to the location
So
I am looking for
NCR regions
But
It is in
The Bangalore region
And if you see
If you see
Since COVID time
It was work from
But right now
I think
Maybe
They have enabled
Work from office
Culture
So
If I don't
Then I have to
Relocate to Bangalore
That is the
That is the main point
Relocation is the main issue
For fishing
Nothing else
Ok
And since our
Our company is
Manufacturing
Yes
So
Maybe a little difference
From your previous
Worker experience
We mainly
To develop
Some
Tours
Or social work
Tours
To support
Our production
Usually like this
Yes
Since in our department
We have
Successfully implemented
Several
Several projects
To help our
Our projects
Our production projects
Usually to support
To support
Apple's projects
Needed
So you are saying
You are having
Mostly presenting
Support
Maintenance
Kind of situation
Right
Yes
So
But I think
It should be a mixture
Of development
And maintenance
Then it's ok
If
It is totally
Maintenance
Then I think
That will be
For that point
I have to think
On that part
Because
I was
I was a part of
Mostly
Team
In that
Develop
Team
So
In maintenance phase
Somehow
I will do the
Maintenance
Phase
That part
I have to think
On that part
But I think
If it is a mix
Mix
Then it's ok
If it is totally
Maintenance
Then it will be
I think
It will be
Ok
I think
That's all of our questions
So
Do you have some
Questions for us
To ask
Ask
Right now
I don't have
Questions
It's ok for me
Ok
If you can
If you can tell something
For us on
Journaling
Dedications
And other things
It will be better
Otherwise
The attitudes
We can get
For you to know
So
That's all
Ok
So
So
It's all about
Today's interview
And
For the
Lecture instruction
I will
After we
Discuss
Internal
Interruptions
I will feedback to our
HR
Indian HR
Departments
And
They will tell you
The lecture instruction
Ok
Ok
Ok
Thank you
Bye bye
Bye bye
Thank you
Bye bye
Bye bye
